# AidChain Smart Contract

## Project Overview

AidChain is a blockchain-centric platform that employs the Celo blockchain network to enhance, facilitate, and instill transparency in charitable pursuits within Nigeria. The platform aims to establish a trustworthy, transparent, and efficient presence in the aid sector.

This project is part of the Celo Africa DAO and Bunz Hackathon initiatives, marking a step forward in leveraging blockchain for social good.

## Getting Started

The source code is written and managed using the Foundry Book package. Foundry is a robust smart contract development toolchain that helps handle dependencies, compile projects, run tests, and interacts with the blockchain via command-line/Solidity scripts.

Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the AidChain repository to your local system.
2. Inside your cloned directory, install the necessary dependencies using Foundry.
3. Compile the smart contract scripts using Foundry's compile command.
4. Deploy the compiled scripts onto the Celo Network using appropriate Foundry commands.
5. Once deployed, you can run tests or interact with the Celo blockchain.
